This is a placeholder file for PWA icons.

For a production environment, you need to create the following icon files:
1. icon-192.png - 192x192 pixels
2. icon-512.png - 512x512 pixels

These icons should be placed in this directory and will be used by the PWA manifest
for installation on devices.

You can generate these icons using online tools like:
- https://app-manifest.firebaseapp.com/
- https://www.pwabuilder.com/
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/

For best results, create a simple, recognizable logo for Leontine that works well
at different sizes and on different background colors.
